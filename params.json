{"name":"Xf86-input-mtrack","tagline":"Xorg Multitouch Trackpad Driver","body":"xf86-input-mtrack\r\n=================\r\n\r\nAn Xorg driver for multitouch trackpads. Supports any trackpad whose kernel\r\ndriver uses the slotted multitouch protocol. For more information on the\r\nprotocol see the [kernel documentation][1].\r\n\r\nThis is a fork of BlueDragon's verion of the driver. Instead of treating the\r\nbottom edge as a dead area, this verion basically ignores touch input in the bottom 40\r\npercent of the trackpad when there is another touch on the upper bit. This makes the\r\ntrackpad much more usable for Cuppertino made notebooks. Hopefully, with only \r\na little more tweaking I can get it to run and feel like the mouse does in other\r\noperating systems. Give it a try, and let me know.\r\n\r\nThis driver is compatible with Xorg server versions 1.7 to 1.12. It requires\r\nthe [mtdev][4] library to operate.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n* Copyright (C) 2011 Ryan Bourgeois <bluedragonx@gmail.com>\r\n* Copyright (C) 2008 Henrik Rydberg <rydberg@euromail.se>\r\n\r\nThis software is licensed under the [GPLv2][2] and is a fork of the\r\n[xf86-input-multitouch][3] driver by Henrik Rydberg.\r\n\r\nBinaries\r\n--------\r\n\r\nI'll try to put some binary packages up soon. I'll need to check through a few dependencies\r\nto make sure it will run on a base ubuntu system. Expect packages soon.\r\n\r\nCompiling\r\n---------\r\n\r\nYou will need to do an 'autoconf -i' to get everything going. Then run the generated 'configure' script. You may\r\nwant to set the prefix to '/usr' (configure --prefix=/usr) Then run make and make install (as root). Then add a file to\r\nyour /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d directory. If you alread have the synaptics driver, then you will need to make sure\r\nthe file for mtrack starts with a higher two didget number.\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe following is a minimal working InputClass section for xorg.conf - or for ubuntu /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/52-mtrack.conf:\r\n\r\n    Section \"InputClass\"\r\n        MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\r\n        Identifier      \"Touchpads\"\r\n        Driver          \"mtrack\"\r\n    EndSection\r\n\r\nConfiguration options may be defined inside the InputClass section to configure\r\nthe driver. Available options and their defaults are as follows.\r\n\r\n**TrackpadDisable** -\r\nDisables trackpad touch input. A value of 0 will enable the trackpad. A value\r\nof 1 will disable tapping and gestures but not movement. A value of 2 will\r\ndisable all input. A value of 3 will also disable physical buttons. Integer.\r\nDefault is 0.\r\n\r\n**Sensitivity** - \r\nAdjusts the sensitivity (movement speed) of the touchpad. This is a real number\r\ngreater than or equal to zero. Default is 1. A value of 0 will disable pointer\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n**FingerHigh** - \r\nDefines the pressure at which a finger is detected as a touch. This is a\r\npercentage represented as an integer. Default is 5.\r\n\r\n**FingerLow** - \r\nDefines the pressure at which a finger is detected as a release. This is a\r\npercentage represented as an integer. Default is 5.\r\n\r\n**IgnoreThumb** - \r\nWhether or not to ignore touches that are determined to be thumbs. Boolean\r\nvalue. Defaults to false.\r\n\r\n**IgnorePalm** - \r\nWhether or not to ignore touches that are determined to be palms. Boolean\r\nvalue. Defaults to false.\r\n\r\n**DisableOnThumb** - \r\nWhether or not to disable the entire trackpad when a thumb is touching. Boolean\r\nvalue. Defaults to false.\r\n\r\n**DisableOnPalm** - \r\nWhether or not to disable the entire trackpad when a palm is touching. Boolean\r\nvalue. Defaults to false.\r\n\r\n**ThumbRatio** - \r\nThe width/length ratio of what's considered a thumb. It is expected that a\r\nthumb is longer than it is wide. This tells the driver how much longer.\r\nPercentage represented by an integer. Defaults to 70.\r\n\r\n**ThumbSize** - \r\nThe minimum size of what's considered a thumb. It is expected that a thumb\r\nwill be larger than other fingers. This is represented as a percentage of the\r\nmaximum touch value and is dependent on the trackpad hardware. Integer value.\r\nDefaults to 25.\r\n\r\n**PalmSize** - \r\nThe minimum size of what's considered a palm. Palms are expected to be very\r\nlarge on the trackpad. This is represented as a percentage of the maximum touch\r\nvalue and is dependent on the trackpad hardware. Integer value. Defaults to 40.\r\n\r\n**BottomEdge** -\r\nThe size of an area at the bottom of the trackpad where new touches are ignored\r\n(fingers traveling into this area from above will still be tracked). This is\r\nrepresented as a percentage of the total trackpad height. Defaults to 10.\r\n\r\n**ButtonEnable** - \r\nWhether or not to enable the physical buttons on or near the trackpad. Boolean\r\nvalue. Defaults to true.\r\n\r\n**ButtonIntegrated** - \r\nWhether or not the physical buttons are integrated with the trackpad. If you\r\nhave a one-piece trackpad like on newer MacBooks, this should be set to true.\r\nButton emulation depends on this value being correct. Boolean value. Defaults\r\nto true.\r\n\r\n**ButtonMoveEmulate**\r\nWhether or not to count the moving finger when emulating button clicks. Useful to disable if you use two hands on trackpad. Boolean value. Defaults to true.\r\n\r\n**ButtonZonesEnable** -\r\nWhether or not to enable button zones. If button zones are enabled then the\r\ntrackpad will be split into one, two, or three vertical zones. Clicking the\r\nintegrated button in one of these zones will send the button event for\r\nClickFinger1, ClickFinger2, or ClickFinger3. The driver will only add zones for\r\nthose ClickFinger values that are enabled. So setting ClickFinger1 to 0 and\r\nenabling the other two will create two zones, one for ClickFinger2 and one for\r\nClickFinger3. Boolean value. Defaults to false.\r\n\r\n**ButtonTouchExpire** - \r\nHow long (in ms) to consider a touching finger as part of button emulation. A\r\nvalue of 0 will not expire touches. Integer value. Defaults to 100.\r\n\r\n**ClickFinger1** - \r\nWhich button to emulate when one finger is touching the trackpad during a\r\nclick. Integer value. A value of 0 disables one-touch emulation. Defaults to 3.\r\n\r\n**ClickFinger2** - \r\nWhich button to emulate when two fingers are touching the trackpad during a\r\nclick. Integer value. A value of 0 disabled one-touch emulation. Defaults to 2.\r\n\r\n**ClickFinger3** - \r\nWhich button to emulate when three fingers are touching the trackpad during a\r\nclick. Integer value. A value of 0 disabled one-touch emulation. Defaults to 0.\r\n\r\n**TapButton1** - \r\nWhich button to emulate for one-finger tapping. Integer value. A value of 0\r\ndisables one-finger tapping. Defaults to 1.\r\n\r\n**TapButton2** - \r\nWhich button to emulate for two-finger tapping. Integer value. A value of 0\r\ndisables two-finger tapping. Defaults to 3.\r\n\r\n**TapButton3** - \r\nWhich button to emulate for three-finger tapping. Integer value. A value of 0\r\ndisables three-finger tapping. Defaults to 2.\r\n\r\n**TapButton4** - \r\nWhich button to emulate for four-finger tapping. Integer value. A value of 0\r\ndisables three-finger tapping. Defaults to 0.\r\n\r\n**ClickTime** - \r\nWhen tapping, how much time to hold down the emulated button. Integer value\r\nrepresenting milliseconds. Defaults to 50.\r\n\r\n**MaxTapTime** - \r\nThe amount of time to wait for a tap to release before counting it as a move.\r\nInteger value representing milliseconds. Defaults to 120.\r\n\r\n**MaxTapMove** - \r\nHow far a touch is allowed to move before counting it is no longer considered a\r\ntap. Integer value. Defaults to 400.\r\n\r\n**GestureClickTime** - \r\nWhen a gesture triggers a click, how much time to hold down the emulated button.\r\nInteger value representing milliseconds. Defaults to 10.\r\n\r\n**GestureWaitTime** - \r\nTouches are allowed to transition from one gesture to another. For example, you\r\nmay go from scrolling to swiping without releasing your fingers from the pad.\r\nThis value is the amount of time you must be performing the new gesture before\r\nit is triggered. This prevents accidental touches from triggering other\r\ngestures. Integer value representing milliseconds. Defaults to 100.\r\n\r\n**ScrollDistance** - \r\nFor two finger scrolling.

Integer value representing milliseconds.\r\nDefaults to 40.\r\n\r\n**TapDragDist**\r\nHow far the finger is allowed to move during drag wait time.
