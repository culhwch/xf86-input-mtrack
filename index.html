          <h1>xf86-input-mtrack</h1>

<p>An Xorg driver for multitouch trackpads. Supports any trackpad whose kernel
driver uses the slotted multitouch protocol. For more information on the
protocol see the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/input/multi-touch-protocol.txt" title="Kernel Multitouch Protocol">kernel documentation</a>.</p>

<p>This is a fork of BlueDragon's verion of the driver. Instead of treating the
bottom edge as a dead area, this verion basically ignores touch input in the bottom 40
percent of the trackpad when there is another touch on the upper bit. This makes the
trackpad much more usable for Cuppertino made notebooks. Hopefully, with only 
a little more tweaking I can get it to run and feel like the mouse does in other
operating systems. Give it a try, and let me know.</p>

<p>This driver is compatible with Xorg server versions 1.7 to 1.12. It requires
the <a href="http://bitmath.org/code/mtdev/" title="mtdev library website">mtdev</a> library to operate.</p>

<h2>Binaries</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/culhwch/xf86-input-mtrack/blob/master/xserver-xorg-input-mtrack-culhwch_0.0.1-0.0.1_amd64.deb" title="Ubuntu build">Ubuntu Raring</a> Use this binary on amd64 Ubuntu Raring systems. (dpkg -i FILENANE) should get you started.
Note that you may need to adjust the configuration file in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/52-mtrack.conf It is 
currently setup to only work on apple builtin trackpads. If you want to try it on different hardware just edit
out the line 'MatchProduct "Apple|bcm5974"'. Please let me know your milleage with this driver.</p>

<h2>Compiling</h2>

<p>You will need to do an 'autoconf -i' to get everything going. Then run the generated 'configure' script. You may
want to set the prefix to '/usr' (configure --prefix=/usr) Then run make and make install (as root). Then add a file to
your /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d directory. If you alread have the synaptics driver, then you will need to make sure
the file for mtrack starts with a higher two didget number.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>The following is a minimal working InputClass section for xorg.conf - or for ubuntu /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/52-mtrack.conf:</p>

<pre><code>Section "InputClass"
    MatchIsTouchpad "on"
    Identifier      "Touchpads"
    Driver          "mtrack"
EndSection
</code></pre>

<p>Configuration options may be defined inside the InputClass section to configure
the driver. Available options and their defaults are as follows.</p>

<p>---Note that some of these settings might not be available.</p>

<p><strong>TrackpadDisable</strong> -
Disables trackpad touch input. A value of 0 will enable the trackpad. A value
of 1 will disable tapping and gestures but not movement. A value of 2 will
disable all input. A value of 3 will also disable physical buttons. Integer.
Default is 0.</p>

<p><strong>Sensitivity</strong> - 
Adjusts the sensitivity (movement speed) of the touchpad. This is a real number
greater than or equal to zero. Default is 1. A value of 0 will disable pointer
movement.</p>

<p><strong>FingerHigh</strong> - 
Defines the pressure at which a finger is detected as a touch. This is a
percentage represented as an integer. Default is 5.</p>

<p><strong>FingerLow</strong> - 
Defines the pressure at which a finger is detected as a release. This is a
percentage represented as an integer. Default is 5.</p>

<p><strong>IgnoreThumb</strong> - 
Whether or not to ignore touches that are determined to be thumbs. Boolean
value. Defaults to false.</p>

<p><strong>IgnorePalm</strong> - 
Whether or not to ignore touches that are determined to be palms. Boolean
value. Defaults to false.</p>

<p><strong>DisableOnThumb</strong> - 
Whether or not to disable the entire trackpad when a thumb is touching. Boolean
value. Defaults to false.</p>

<p><strong>DisableOnPalm</strong> - 
Whether or not to disable the entire trackpad when a palm is touching. Boolean
value. Defaults to false.</p>

<p><strong>ThumbRatio</strong> - 
The width/length ratio of what's considered a thumb. It is expected that a
thumb is longer than it is wide. This tells the driver how much longer.
Percentage represented by an integer. Defaults to 70.</p>

<p><strong>ThumbSize</strong> - 
The minimum size of what's considered a thumb. It is expected that a thumb
will be larger than other fingers. This is represented as a percentage of the
maximum touch value and is dependent on the trackpad hardware. Integer value.
Defaults to 25.</p>

<p><strong>PalmSize</strong> - 
The minimum size of what's considered a palm. Palms are expected to be very
large on the trackpad. This is represented as a percentage of the maximum touch
value and is dependent on the trackpad hardware. Integer value. Defaults to 40.</p>

<p><strong>BottomEdge</strong> -
The size of an area at the bottom of the trackpad where new touches are ignored
(fingers traveling into this area from above will still be tracked). This is
represented as a percentage of the total trackpad height. Defaults to 10.</p>

<p><strong>ButtonEnable</strong> - 
Whether or not to enable the physical buttons on or near the trackpad. Boolean
value. Defaults to true.</p>

<p><strong>ButtonIntegrated</strong> - 
Whether or not the physical buttons are integrated with the trackpad. If you
have a one-piece trackpad like on newer MacBooks, this should be set to true.
Button emulation depends on this value being correct. Boolean value. Defaults
to true.</p>

<p><strong>ButtonMoveEmulate</strong>
Whether or not to count the moving finger when emulating button clicks. Useful to disable if you use two hands on trackpad. Boolean value. Defaults to true.</p>

<p><strong>ButtonZonesEnable</strong> -
Whether or not to enable button zones. If button zones are enabled then the
trackpad will be split into one, two, or three vertical zones. Clicking the
integrated button in one of these zones will send the button event for
ClickFinger1, ClickFinger2, or ClickFinger3. The driver will only add zones for
those ClickFinger values that are enabled. So setting ClickFinger1 to 0 and
enabling the other two will create two zones, one for ClickFinger2 and one for
ClickFinger3. Boolean value. Defaults to false.</p>

<p><strong>ButtonTouchExpire</strong> - 
How long (in ms) to consider a touching finger as part of button emulation. A
value of 0 will not expire touches. Integer value. Defaults to 100.</p>

<p><strong>ClickFinger1</strong> - 
Which button to emulate when one finger is touching the trackpad during a
click. Integer value. A value of 0 disables one-touch emulation. Defaults to 3.</p>

<p><strong>ClickFinger2</strong> - 
Which button to emulate when two fingers are touching the trackpad during a
click. Integer value. A value of 0 disabled one-touch emulation. Defaults to 2.</p>

<p><strong>ClickFinger3</strong> - 
Which button to emulate when three fingers are touching the trackpad during a
click. Integer value. A value of 0 disabled one-touch emulation. Defaults to 0.</p>

<p><strong>TapButton1</strong> - 
Which button to emulate for one-finger tapping. Integer value. A value of 0
disables one-finger tapping. Defaults to 1.</p>

<p><strong>TapButton2</strong> - 
Which button to emulate for two-finger tapping. Integer value. A value of 0
disables two-finger tapping. Defaults to 3.</p>

<p><strong>TapButton3</strong> - 
Which button to emulate for three-finger tapping. Integer value. A value of 0
disables three-finger tapping. Defaults to 2.</p>

<p><strong>TapButton4</strong> -

time pointer movement will be disabled. Increase this value if you find you're
draggin when you don't wish it. Integer value representing milliseconds.
Defaults to 40.</p>

<p><strong>TapDragDist</strong>
How far the finger is allowed to move during drag wait time. If the finger
moves farther than this distance during the wait time then dragging will be
canceled and pointer movement will resume. Integer value. Defaults to 200.</p>
